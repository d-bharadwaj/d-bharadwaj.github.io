Hello! I'm a 2nd-year PhD student in CSE @ University of Michigan, advised by [Dr. Gokul Ravi](https://gsravi.engin.umich.edu/). 
My research combines Quantum Computing and High-Performance Computing (HPC) to push towards practical quantum advantage. I'm also a [MICDE](https://micde.umich.edu/) graduate fellow (2024 cohort).

I spent Summer 2024 at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/solutions/quantum-computing/), where I worked on accelerating tensor network simulations for cuQuantum. Previously, I interned at the startup [qBraid](https://www.qbraid.com/), profiling quantum circuits and benchmarking GPU-based simulations, and at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/directorate/ccsd), developing quantum machine learning models and hardware-efficient circuits for complex datasets.
